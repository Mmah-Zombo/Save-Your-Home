## Usage

1. Enter the location that you want weather data for and click the search button or the **ENTER** key on your key board.
2. Your browser's display will change to a page with a search button and a list containing the results of at most five places, that match the location you entered. _By defualt the app displays the weather condition of the first location that matches your input_.
3. To see the weather info for any of the listed locations **CLICK** it, and the info will be displayed in the content section below the search button
4. For _desktops and tabs_ the left of the content section contains the current weather condition for the selected location and the left contains a 12 hour weather forecast at intervals of 3 for the selected location.
5. For _smart phones_ the top of the content section contains the current weather condition for the selected location and the bottom contains a 12 hour weather forecast at intervals of 3 for the selected location.
   
**NOTE**: <br>
Country name codes are used instead of the country names. Example "Sierra Leone" becomes "SL". You can use a third party application to convert counrty name codes to country names.

The speed of your internet affects the app's load time.

The accuracy of the weather data is dependent on the Open Weather APIs used.

## What Inspired This Project (My Story)

>This project was inspired by my drive to solve one of __UN'S GLOBAL GOALS__. 

Since tackling climate change is one of them I decided to build a web app that helps people to keep track of their communities' climate conditions and guide them on actions to take in other to save their communities from adverse climate change. 

As a starting point, I have built this weather app to help people keep track of the weather conditIons of every place on earth, for it is one of the major factors in monitoring our planet's climate.
